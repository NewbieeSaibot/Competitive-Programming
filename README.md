# Competitive Programming Training

> Short Description

Hi, I'm Tobias Rossi MÃ¼ller and this is my repository of competitive programming codes. If you liked the content consider giving it a star.
I'm just a novice training for ICPC and code interviews, so the content is not as high level as it can be found on the internet, but it's still a good way to keep your workouts more organized. This solutions are from codeforces problems (https://codeforces.com/). Another cool repository of a friend and teammate is https://github.com/GabrielEstevam/icpc_contest_training. The solutions of this repository are from https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/ website.

> ICPC

International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) is a competition among universities of all world. The basic idea is that you have a limited time to solve some programming problems and your solution will be judge by a script with test cases. Your solution must pass in a time and memory limit and be correct for all tests.
More can be found on the official website: https://icpc.global/.
